# Hash Map Project for TOP

## Key Learnings

* When and why to use a hashing function
* Why a hash lookup is so fast, with O(1) time complexity.
* How to create Linked Lists inside Array slots.
* Array.forEach() skips empty buckets, use a for loop for more granular control

## Reminders

* Building a Linked List from scratch
* Traversing a Linked List 
* "Building a house from the inside out"
* Porting a simple app from Node to the Browser

(I in fact re-did the Linked List project to get a better understanding for hash maps)
